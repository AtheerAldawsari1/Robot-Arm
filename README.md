# Robot Arm Control and Simulation with ROS

This task aims to control a robot arm model using the ROS (Robot Operating System) and simulate its movement using RViz and Gazebo simulations.


## Instructions 

1. Install VirtualBox on your device.
2. Download Ubuntu 22.04 LTS on VirtualBox from the following link: [https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/ â†—](https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/)
3. Install ROS Noetic on Ubuntu which can be found on this website: http (http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu): (http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu)//wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu (http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu)
4. Finally, to check if ROS is working properly, enter "roscore" in the terminal on Ubuntu.

To get started, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a Catkin workspace.
2. Use the commands provided in this link ([https://github.com/smart-methods/arduino_robot_arm)
4. Launch Rviz by running the command "$ roslaunch robot_arm_pkg check_motors.launch".
5. Launch Gasebo by running the command "$ roslaunch robot_arm_pkg check_motors_gazebo.launch".
